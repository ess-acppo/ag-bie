###    [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/ala-bie.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/ala-bie)

This is the ALA version of the BIE front end.
For more details on the architecture see [BIE index](http://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/bie-index)

Separation of concerns between the organisation specific application (ala-bie) and the plugin is that
this application is responsible for configuration, styling and layout.
